# TrackSystem

## Preemble

This was created for an interview example to show-off skills.

### Task: 
The plugin should essentially be a replica of LuckPerms' track system. You're able to promote a player up a track of, say, 5 ranks. If they're at the top, don't let them go any further. Same for the bottom.

### Road Map
[+] Creating Tracks
[+] Creating Ranks
[+] Reading User Infos
[+] Promoting Users
[+] Setting the track of a user
[+] Demoting Users
[+] Rank Weight Change

### Result (No further updates)

Work done. Time consumed (~2 hours 45 mins), no framework used. 
Things I have not included, because they are overkill for a demo, are:
- Persistence (saving to a database and stuff)
- A proper Messaging-System with configurations
    -> Therefore are most of the messages monotone and boring. This is more likely the job of an Administrator to make it look pretty IMO
