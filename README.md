# TrackSystem

## Preamble

This was created for an interview example to show-off skills.

### Task: 
The plugin should essentially be a replica of LuckPerms' track system. You're able to promote a player up a track of, say, 5 ranks. If they're at the top, don't let them go any further. Same for the bottom.

### Road Map
[+] Creating Tracks</br> 
[+] Creating Ranks</br> 
[+] Reading User Infos</br> 
[+] Promoting Users</br> 
[+] Setting the track of a user</br> 
[+] Demoting Users</br> 
[+] Rank Weight Change</br> 

### Result (No further updates)

Work done. Time consumed (~2 hours 45 mins), no framework used. </br> 
Things I have not included, because they are overkill for a demo, are:</br> 
- Persistence (saving to a database and stuff)</br> 
- A proper Messaging-System with configurations</br> 
    -> Therefore are most of the messages monotone and boring. </br> 
    -> This is more likely the job of an Administrator to make it look pretty IMO </br>
